# Anki-overdrive-with-raspberry-pi

This project I am making consist of a macbook pro (2017?) and a raspberry pi or something similar to run the server.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44050f9d-6b86-48ed-84a9-a3b0f52888ad)

I am taking inspo on the actual app and its ability to attack other cars and using a device to control it easily.


I would love help on this project as I am not such a expert in ble controls.
